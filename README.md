# RISC-V-Pipeline

This repository hosts an implementation of a RISC-V processor project in SystemVerilog. The primary goal of the project is to offer a dependable and high-performance solution for executing RISC-V instructions. For additional information on the implementation, please refer to the [report.pdf](https://github.com/nathaliafab/RISC-V-PipeLine/blob/d0d2d83ff90d0e071557eb5d13ee30f7c6feeee4/doc/report.pdf).

## Resources
To get started with the RISC-V instruction set, please refer to the following resources:
- [The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume I: User-Level ISA - Document Version 2.2](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf)

To simulate and test the RISC-V processor project, please use the following software:
- [ModelSim-IntelÂ® FPGAs Standard Edition Software Version 20.1.1](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/750666/modelsim-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-20-1-1.html)
